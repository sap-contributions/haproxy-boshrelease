# Version definitions for the AWS-LC / crypto packages (cmake, aws-lc, aws-lc-fips).
#
# Kept separate from haproxy-versions.sh on purpose: BOSH fingerprints each
# package by the contents of the files it bundles. If these versions lived in
# haproxy-versions.sh (which the crypto packages would then bundle), every
# HAProxy/lua/pcre/socat/hatop bump would change the crypto packages'
# fingerprints and force an unnecessary AWS-LC recompile (~30 min). With this
# split, the aws-lc/cmake fingerprints only change when a crypto version does,
# so the director reuses the cached compiled artifact across HAProxy bumps.
